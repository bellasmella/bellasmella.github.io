          <section class="content"><p>The first day of our Portugal trip was a hectic one to say the&nbsp;least.</p>
<p>After an intense week of rehearsals and 3 consecutive <span class="caps">KCL</span> dance show performances, we woke up at 7 on Saturday morning.&nbsp;Brutal.</p>
<p>Crisis number one: Alex wasn’t done packing so he spent over an hour frantically running around the house with his packing list in hand. Eventually we set off and after a speedy drive to Victoria station and a sprint to the platform, we made it on the train to&nbsp;Gatwick…phew!</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>

<p>The flight was uneventful from my perspective – I snoozed the whole time. At Porto airport we took a shuttle to the car rental area and picked up our Volkswagen Up (if they only knew what was going to happen to it…). Finally, the real trip was about to&nbsp;start.</p>
<p>Porto is the second largest city in Portugal and one of the oldest European centres with the earliest settlements dating back to 300 <span class="caps">BC</span> – in fact, its Celtic-Latin name, Portus Cales, is the origin of the country’s&nbsp;name.</p>
<p>Once in the centre, we experienced for the first time the joys of looking for a parking spot in Portugal. After going in circles for about 20 minutes, we finally parked on a dodgy hill next to the station (not sure we were even allowed to park&nbsp;there!).</p>
<p>We started our exploration of the historic centre with the São Bento train station, famous for its azulejo panels. Designed by Jorge Colaço, the most important azulejo painter of his time, and constituted of 20,000 tiles, they depict landscapes, ethnographic scenes and historical&nbsp;events.</p>

<p>After having a quick look at the Porto cathedral, we headed off to the Sao Francisco Church, considered to be one of Brazil’s most magnificent churches. Unfortunately, it was closed so we couldn’t see the&nbsp;inside.</p>

<p>The disappointment didn’t last long as it was time for an equally (who am I kidding, it was actually an even more) exciting activity: dinner. We picked a restaurant next to the station suggested by tripadvisor, Tapabento, but without a reservation it was impossible to get a table. The lady recommended us another place nearby called Cantina 32, and even phoned them to make sure we would get a table. The food and service were great – we had grilled prawns with fries, salad and&nbsp;couscous.</p>
<p>Halfway through dinner, our airbnb host sent us a message saying that she had to leave soon and we needed to get the keys from her. We originally agreed to meet her at 8 but thought she would be home the rest of the evening – apparently not, she was off to the North of Portugal for the weekend. We shoved as much food as we could down our throats, paid for the meal, ran to the car, and emergency-drove to her place in 20 minutes. That was crisis number 2.
After settling in our room, we realised we didn’t have any drinking water. “No problemo” we thought, “there is a Froiz in the centre that closes in 15 minutes”. We made it in time, got water, all was good. That was until the <span class="caps">GPS</span> ran out of battery and the charging cable refused to work – crisis number 3. We tried to find our way back but of course got lost instead, drove up and down what felt like every single goddamn hill in that stupid town, and finally got home an hour&nbsp;later.</p>
